Problem Statement: 
  - Loan approval decisions are often manual and time-consuming
  - Banks & financial institutions need an automated system to predict loan approvals effienciently
  - Automating the process saves time as well as can reduce bias in loan-approval by lendors

We used the following libraries to help tackle the model-building step of the project:
  - pandas
  - sci-kit learn
  - joblib
  - matplotlib
